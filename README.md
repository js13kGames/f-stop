My submission for the 2024 js13kGames competition. Unfortunately, I was not able to come up with a game concept in time, so this was submitted to the "Unfinished" category as a tech demo. 
I still wanted to submit this however because I am proud of the hard work this took to acheive real-time raytracing on voxels of this scale inside of the browser in under 13kb. In the demo,
there are a total of 187,500 voxels.
